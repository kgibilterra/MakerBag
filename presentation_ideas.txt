- can't find someone while hiking
- traveling and afraid of someone stealing from out of your bag
- bad posture from holding a heavy bag

What if there was a repository of projects that you could build to solve for these problems
Stop waiting for someone else to solve your most pressing problems

Maker Bags...

demo the website (don't highlight our "created" bags, show that anyone will be able to add their own projects for others to view

demo the three devices - beacon tracker, make sound/send text, update LCD screen

talk about how this could become a community of makers
- we have started to create starter bags - projects for people to learn from
- show the different styles of bags
- talk about how we will continue to build projects with ways of connecting projects together
- add in projects that will make the devices more usable
- next step will be to build the whole site from the ground up
- November launch?
