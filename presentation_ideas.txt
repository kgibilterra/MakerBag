amusement park story - lost from their parents


This inspired Wanderful bag. We've created 3 hardware demos to display
- show the phone
- show the LCD screen
- show the backpack

These are some of the things that we are exicted to build for if we ever have kids. But while we were building,
we started talking about how this situation could apply to many types of bags and users. So with that in mind, we have
started creating a Maker Bag space. On here contributers from everywhere can come and find ways to add individualized
"internet of things" projects and build bags that fit their unique needs.






Presentation Ideas

Should we start with some problems?
- http://www.today.com/news/jeff-rossen-social-experiment-will-people-help-lost-child-1D80112770 (lost 11 year old kid)
- can't find someone while hiking
- traveling and afraid of someone stealing from out of your bag
- bad posture from holding a heavy bag

What if there was a repository of projects that you could build to solve for these problems
Stop waiting for someone else to solve your most pressing problems

Maker Bags...

demo the website (don't highlight our "created" bags, show that anyone will be able to add their own projects for others to view

demo the three devices - beacon tracker, make sound/send text, update LCD screen

talk about how this could become a community of makers
- we have started to create starter bags - projects for people to learn from
- show the different styles of bags
- talk about how we will continue to build projects with ways of connecting projects together
- add in projects that will make the devices more usable
- next step will be to build the whole site from the ground up
- November launch?



ALTERNATIVE

show the projects in the bags, we made "this, and this, and this, and this"
Phrase it in a way so that it inspires creativity for people to make more things for their bag
Show them the site and say that we are creating a repository where anyone can become a maker
Individualized "internet of things"
