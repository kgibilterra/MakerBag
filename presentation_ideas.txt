Hershey Park - lots of lost kids
one solution is to strap your kid to a leash
today we have created the alternative to that leash

We created this solution only using the 
technologies that came in our kits that will 
connect parents to their children 
without the kid having a phone and only 
needing a wifi network

Without further ado, we will kick off our 
3 Wanderful demos starting with the
beacon tracker app

- show the phone
- show the LCD screen
- show the backpack

how will Crystal tell her parents where she is?
left shoulder - gps location to mom
right shoulder - buzzer to alert those 
around her if she is scared
powered using twilio, a myfi, and a battery pack 
so that she is fully portable and even able 
to find her parent during a zombie apocalypse

And we have one more thing! as we built, 
we realized how fun and powerful it would 
be for everyone to be able to make
projects like these on their own
So we have built the maker bag site where 
everyone will be able to open source their 
awesome bag creations whether it is
a backpack, purse, briefcase, or sportsbag. 
We are excited to keep building on this and 
see what awesome bags we will
all be able to make in the future!






Presentation Ideas

Should we start with some problems?
- http://www.today.com/news/jeff-rossen-social-experiment-will-people-help-lost-child-1D80112770 (lost 11 year old kid)
- can't find someone while hiking
- traveling and afraid of someone stealing from out of your bag
- bad posture from holding a heavy bag

What if there was a repository of projects that you could build to solve for these problems
Stop waiting for someone else to solve your most pressing problems

Maker Bags...

demo the website (don't highlight our "created" bags, show that anyone will be able to add their own projects for others to view

demo the three devices - beacon tracker, make sound/send text, update LCD screen

talk about how this could become a community of makers
- we have started to create starter bags - projects for people to learn from
- show the different styles of bags
- talk about how we will continue to build projects with ways of connecting projects together
- add in projects that will make the devices more usable
- next step will be to build the whole site from the ground up
- November launch?



ALTERNATIVE

show the projects in the bags, we made "this, and this, and this, and this"
Phrase it in a way so that it inspires creativity for people to make more things for their bag
Show them the site and say that we are creating a repository where anyone can become a maker
Individualized "internet of things"
